# Motors
 Design a control system for different types of motors
 
 DC motor: takes electrical power through direct current, and converts this energy into mechanical rotation
 
 Stepper motor: moves in discrete steps.it has multiple coils that are organized in groups. By energizing each phase in sequence, the motor will rotate, one step at a time.
 
 Servo motor: rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.
